Convert a movie of a display of a balance into a table with `time` and `weight` using OCR

## Why this package?

Suppose, you have a good electronic balance and you want 
to weigh time dependend forces. So you will get a timeseries of weights, 
and you want this timesieries in a digital way.
Suppose, your balance can be connected to a computer to read the weights directly into a computer. Would be nice.

But now, suppose the balance is too old or all available computers 
are too new and the connection between the balance and your computer 
can not be made! Nightmare!

**Solution**

Take your cellphone, record a movie of the display of the balance during your experiment, load the movie into your computer, convert the movie into a table with `time` and `weight` using OCR. Everyone happy!
